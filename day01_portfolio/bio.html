                <p>Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. Well, you're very
                    similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. Why do you
                    have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head? I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English.
                    Kidneys! I have kidneys. And I don't like the colour. The Doctor. Nosey parker. No, not the hugging.
                    I'm against the hugging. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Can I talk about planets
                    now?</p>
